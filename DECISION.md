# Decision: Autonomous Roundtable Orchestrator Architecture

**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Status:** Closed
**Evidence:** `ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md` — six questions, three agents (Codex ×3,
Gemini ×3, IC ×3), four rounds

---

## Summary

Build a roundtable orchestrator **on top of Jido 2.0** in Elixir, packaged as
a Nix flake app. Active per-question discussion lives in GitHub Issues;
durable artifacts (BRIEF, DECISION, transcripts) stay in git. Agents are
invoked as CLI subprocesses; the orchestrator owns all GitHub side effects.

## Decisions

### Foundation — Jido 2.0

Use `{:jido, "~> 2.0"}` as the runtime foundation. Do not roll a custom
`GenServer` + `System.cmd/3` inline loop.

- Each CLI agent invocation is a `Jido.Action` (`RunCliAgent`).
- State transitions (`continue → satisfied → closed`) are the orchestrator
  agent's `cmd/2` function — pure, unit-testable without running any LLMs or
  hitting GitHub.
- Side effects (`gh issue comment`, `gh issue edit`, `gh issue close`) are
  `Directive`s executed by the Jido runtime, not inline in action logic.
- `Jido.Signal`s carry events between the orchestrator and any future
  sub-agents or watchers.
- OTP supervision and fault tolerance are inherited from Jido's runtime — no
  custom supervisor tree needed for v1.

**Defer `jido_ai` to v2.** IC triage in v1 uses a raw `claude -p` CLI call
via `RunCliAgent`, same as participant invocations. `jido_ai` becomes relevant
if an Elixir-native selector, summarizer, or fallback judge is needed later.

### Shared State — Hybrid

| Content | Medium | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Active per-question turns | GitHub Issues | Atomic writes, no merge conflicts, parallel-agent safe |
| Question satisfaction state | Issue labels | Machine-readable without prose parsing |
| Question lifecycle | Issue open/closed | Natural termination signal |
| BRIEF, DECISION, ATTRIBUTION | Git-tracked files | Durable, reviewable, version-controlled |
| Session index (Q# → issue#) | `ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md` in git | Stable pointer; not written during live rounds |
| Transcripts/archives | Git-tracked files | Persist after issues close |

Do not write agent positions to `ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md` during live rounds.
That file is updated by the orchestrator only when opening or closing a
discussion, not turn-by-turn.

### Turn Protocol — Round-Robin + IC Close

- Fixed agent order within a question: `[codex, gemini, claude_ic]`.
  `claude_ic` runs last as the IC; it synthesises, issues the next prompt,
  and decides whether to continue or close.
- Questions can run in parallel across GitHub Issues using
  `Task.async_stream/3` (or Jido's equivalent `await_all`). Questions with
  declared dependencies must be sequenced; independent questions are parallel.
- One round = all agents have commented once on a given question.

### Termination — Labels Primary, IC Triage Fallback

1. After each agent posts, the orchestrator reads
   `gh issue view <n> --json labels,state,comments`.
2. If all active agents have a `satisfied` or `satisfied-conditional` label
   and none have `needs-more-evidence`, the issue is closed.
3. If an agent's response contains no detectable satisfaction marker, the
   orchestrator invokes `claude_ic` with a triage prompt: *"Does the latest
   comment on this question indicate satisfaction? Reply: satisfied /
   satisfied-conditional / needs-more-evidence."* The IC response sets the label.
4. `max_rounds` (default 5) reached without consensus → orchestrator posts a
   summary comment, adds a `needs-human-review` label, leaves the issue open,
   and exits.

### CLI Agent Invocation

The orchestrator, not the agent, handles all GitHub mutations. Agents only
produce prose.

```
# Prompt construction
prompt = Roundtable.Prompt.build(brief_path, issue_json, agent_role)

# Invocation (per-agent headless flags confirmed against installed versions)
claude 2.1.83:    claude -p --output-format json  <<< prompt
codex 0.116.0:    printf prompt | codex exec - --json --output-last-message /tmp/out
gemini 0.35.0:    gemini -p prompt --output-format json

# Posting (orchestrator side effect)
gh issue comment <n> --body-file <rendered_response>
gh issue edit    <n> --add-label satisfied --remove-label needs-more-evidence
gh issue close   <n>
```

**Q1 caveat (Codex):** headless flags and auth preconditions confirmed
locally. One live end-to-end scripted run per agent is still needed to
characterise output truncation/edge cases before hardening the parser.
This is a production-hardening item, not a blocker for the v1 scaffold.

### Implementation Form — Elixir/Mix + Nix Flake

- `mix new roundtable --sup` with `{:jido, "~> 2.0"}` in `mix.exs`.
- Entry point: `mix run -e 'Roundtable.CLI.main(["docs/design/BRIEF.md"])'`
- Nix flake provides a `devShell` with Elixir + Erlang + `gh` + the three
  CLI agents. A `packages.default` app output wraps `mix run` as `roundtable`.
- No Docker, no external database, no message broker.

---

## What Needs Building (Domain Pieces)

Jido provides the runtime. These modules are project-specific:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Roundtable.Actions.RunCliAgent` | `System.cmd/3` wrapper for claude/codex/gemini |
| `Roundtable.Actions.Gh.*` | `gh issue view/comment/edit/close` wrappers |
| `Roundtable.Prompt` | Assemble BRIEF.md + issue JSON + agent role → prompt string |
| `Roundtable.Satisfaction` | Parse/apply label policy from agent response |
| `Roundtable.Scheduler` | Round-robin agent order, dependency-aware question sequencing |
| `Roundtable.CLI` | Entry point: parse BRIEF, create/load issues, run rounds |

---

## What Is Deferred

- `jido_ai` integration — defer to v2; IC triage uses raw `claude -p` in v1
- Filesystem-only offline fallback mode — defer; GitHub Issues is the primary path
- Parallel question execution — implement after sequential single-question
  proof-of-concept works end-to-end
- Automated issue creation from BRIEF.md — v1 may create issues manually;
  automate in v2
- `OpenCodeHarness` backend — defer to v2; enables GitHub Copilot and Opencode
  Go as first-class participants via `opencode serve` HTTP API
- `GitHubAPI` and `CodeStorage` git backends — defer to v2; `LocalGit` is
  sufficient for v1 finalization writes

## Open Questions (not yet decided)

**PR review as a coordination surface**

The current orchestrator design handles the discussion loop (Issues) and the
artifact write loop (git commits). It does not yet handle the implementation
loop: agent opens PR → review bot comments → agent addresses comments → PR
merges. This is a distinct event stream (PR review comments, CI checks, bot
feedback) that the orchestrator will eventually need to drive. Defer to v2;
the PR review loop requires `Roundtable.Actions.Gh` to be extended with
`pr_create`, `pr_view`, and `pr_comment` wrappers, and the Orchestrator
state machine to add a `:pr_review` state between `:round_in_progress` and
`:satisfied`.

**Q10.3 — Mid-discussion join context**

What compressed context does a new agent receive when joining a discussion that
is already in progress (e.g., round 3 of 5)?

Options:
- Full issue comment history (accurate but token-expensive at round 3+)
- Last N comments only, same as a turn prompt (cheap but loses early positions)
- IC-generated summary comment posted to the issue before the join turn (accurate,
  bounded, but requires an extra IC invocation)
- Current satisfaction state only: open questions + current labels, no prose

No decision made. Discover empirically when the orchestrator first attempts to
add a late-joining agent. The `Roundtable.Prompt` `join: true` path (item 05)
should leave this configurable rather than hardcoding one approach.

---

## Starting Point

```
mix new roundtable --sup
cd roundtable
# Add to mix.exs deps: {:jido, "~> 2.0"}
mix deps.get
# Implement in order:
# 1. Roundtable.Actions.Gh       — gh CLI wrappers (unit-testable with mock)
# 2. Roundtable.Actions.RunCliAgent — CLI agent invocation
# 3. Roundtable.Satisfaction     — label policy
# 4. Roundtable.Prompt           — prompt assembly
# 5. Roundtable.Orchestrator     — Jido.Agent with cmd/2 loop
# 6. Roundtable.CLI              — entry point
# 7. flake.nix                   — devShell + app wrapper
```

Build `Gh` actions first — they are the most testable (mock `System.cmd/3`)
and the most likely source of environment-specific surprises (auth, rate limits,
field names in `gh --json` output).

---

## Protocol Update 6 — Mobile Supervision Architecture (Q18, 2026-04-28)

**Decision:** Companion REST + SSE API is the canonical mobile contract; LiveView dashboard is the primary browser UI.

### Ruled out
- **LiveView Native** — archived February 10, 2026. Do not use.
- **OpenCode fork as primary path** — satisfaction labels and round triggering absent from OpenCode data model; upstream moves at ~1 release/day. Deferred to v2 if supervision scope expands.

### Required additions (v1)

**Push notifications:**
- Orchestrator emits HTTP POST to ntfy.sh on `consensus_reached` and `needs_human_review` events.
- Config: `NTFY_TOPIC` env var. When unset, notifications are silently skipped.
- ntfy.sh is the default backend (self-hostable, free iOS app). Pushover is an acceptable alternative via the same abstraction.

**Companion API (new module: `RoundtableWeb.ApiController`):**
```
GET  /api/state             — map of issue_number => state_map (same shape as get_discussion_state/1)
GET  /api/events            — SSE stream; events: agent_done, round_start, consensus_reached, needs_human_review
POST /api/questions         — body: {text: String} — calls inject_question/3
POST /api/rounds/trigger    — body: {} — calls start_discussion/2 in background Task
```
Authentication: bearer token in `Authorization` header; token set via `ROUNDTABLE_API_TOKEN` env var.

**PWA:**
- LiveView dashboard served with `manifest.json` (name, icons, display: standalone, start_url: /).
- iOS 16.4+ Web Push via Service Worker is the alerting path for home-screen installs.

### Mobile supervision feature classification
| Task | Mechanism | Real-time |
|---|---|---|
| Watch | SSE `/api/events` | Yes |
| Alert | ntfy.sh / Pushover push | Yes (out-of-app) |
| Inject | POST `/api/questions` | No |
| Trigger | POST `/api/rounds/trigger` | No |

Apple Shortcuts can drive Inject and Trigger against the companion API with no native app required.

## Protocol Update 7 — Orchestrator Structural Improvements (Q19, 2026-04-28)

**Decision:** Three concrete structural improvements derived from the agent orchestration framework survey (Symphony, LangGraph, AutoGen/AG2, CrewAI, Temporal).

### New work items to implement (items 11, 12, 13)

**Item 11 — `Roundtable.RoundRun` persisted state**
```elixir
%Roundtable.RoundRun{
  issue_number: pos_integer(),
  phase: :awaiting_turns | :triage_missing_markers | :consensus_check
        | :closed | :needs_human_review | :needs_human_input,
  expected_speakers: [atom()],
  completed_speakers: [atom()],
  last_comment_ids: [String.t()],
  satisfaction_map: %{atom() => atom()},
  retry_count: non_neg_integer()
}
```
Persisted to ETS + periodic flush to `state/` git-tracked directory. On restart, reconcile from `gh issue view --json labels,state,comments`.

**Item 12 — Explicit phase state machine in `Roundtable.Orchestrator`**
Replace recursive `do_rounds/7` with named phase transition functions. Each phase function is pure: takes `RoundRun`, returns `{next_run, [effect]}`. Effects (gh calls, CLI invocations) are applied separately. Makes phases testable and replay-safe.

Phase transitions:
```
:awaiting_turns
  → all expected speakers completed → :triage_missing_markers
  → max_rounds exceeded → :needs_human_review

:triage_missing_markers
  → all markers present → :consensus_check
  → IC triage completes → :consensus_check

:consensus_check
  → all [satisfied|satisfied-conditional], no [needs-more-evidence] → :closed
  → any [needs-more-evidence] → :awaiting_turns (next round)
  → max_rounds → :needs_human_review

:needs_human_input  (new — HITL interrupt)
  → operator approves/dismisses → resumes from suspended phase
```

**Item 13 — OTEL span taxonomy**
Define and emit spans for each orchestrator event:
```
roundtable.issue.poll       — gh issue view call
roundtable.agent.turn       — RunCliAgent invocation (includes agent, issue_number)
roundtable.gh.comment       — gh issue comment post
roundtable.satisfaction.parse — marker extraction from agent response
roundtable.ic.triage        — IC classification call
roundtable.consensus.check  — Satisfaction.consensus? evaluation
roundtable.issue.close      — gh issue close
```
Wire via Jido telemetry. Export to OTEL collector in prod; log to structured stdout in dev.

### LiveView dashboard updates (item 10 extension)
- Display current `RoundRun.phase` per question alongside satisfaction badge
- Show `completed_speakers` vs `expected_speakers` progress
- Add approve/dismiss button for `:needs_human_input` phase

### What was ruled out
- Importing LangGraph, Temporal, or AutoGen as runtimes — borrow patterns, not runtimes
- Conductor pre-stage (Symphony-style agent selector) — deferred to v2
- Directed IC routing (re-invoke specific agent) — deferred to v2
- Replacing Jido with another runtime — Jido is the right substrate

### Correction — Symphony is Elixir, not Python (2026-04-28)

The Q19 IC synthesis incorrectly characterised `openai/symphony` as Python-based. **Correction:**

- **Symphony the spec:** language-agnostic (`SPEC.md`).
- **Symphony the reference implementation:** written in **Elixir** (95.5% of repo). OpenAI's April 27, 2026 post explicitly states: *"The reference implementation is written in Elixir"* and cites concurrency and OTP supervision as the reason.
- Gemini's Q19.1 Elixir claim was correct; the IC's rejection of it was wrong and is retracted.
- Consequence: Symphony is a **directly relevant Elixir reference architecture**, not just a tangential comparison. Its workspace isolation, boot reconciliation, and `WORKFLOW.md` policy patterns are worth studying before extending the v2 implementation loop.
- Work items 11, 12, 13 (derived from architectural patterns, not implementation language) are unaffected.

---

## Protocol Update 8 — Coordinator Failover and Degraded-Mode Continuity (Q20 precondition, 2026-04-28)

**Decision:** The system must treat **coordinator/IC unavailability** as a
first-class orchestration failure mode, not an ad hoc human-relay event.

### Failure mode observed

During the Q20 handoff, the primary discussion leader became unable to
continue orchestration due to provider overload. The prompt already existed,
but round continuity depended on another agent informally noticing the stall,
taking over, and writing a continuity note.

That is operationally unsafe. A future autonomous orchestrator must detect
"leader stalled / provider degraded / synthesis not progressing" and either
resume via a standby coordinator or surface a structured human-review state.

### Required robustness additions

**Coordinator lease + heartbeat**
- Each active round has a recorded coordinator identity and lease timestamp.
- Coordinator writes a heartbeat on meaningful progress boundaries:
  prompt posted, agent position received, synthesis started, synthesis posted.
- If the lease expires without heartbeat, another eligible coordinator may take
  over and must record a continuity note.

**Resumable synthesis state**
- `Roundtable.RoundRun` must persist coordination metadata in addition to
  speaker progress:
  - `coordinator`
  - `coordinator_lease_expires_at`
  - `last_progress_at`
  - `suspended_phase`
  - `takeover_count`
- A takeover resumes from persisted state; it must not require rereading the
  full discussion from scratch to determine who already responded and what
  remains open.

**Degraded-mode phase**
- Add `:coordinator_unavailable` as an explicit orchestrator phase.
- Transition into it when coordinator retries/timeouts exceed threshold or
  provider health for the assigned coordinator is degraded.
- Exit paths:
  - standby coordinator takeover → resume prior suspended phase
  - human operator ack → `:needs_human_input`
  - repeated takeover failure → `:needs_human_review`

**Provider diversity for the coordinator role**
- The same provider family should not be a single point of failure for both
  participant reasoning and IC synthesis.
- Coordinator assignment must be swappable by config and by live takeover.

**Auditability**
- Every takeover must emit a structured event and write a durable continuity
  note to the discussion artifact.

### New work item

**Item 14 — Coordinator failover**
- standby coordinator selection policy
- lease/heartbeat persistence in `RoundRun`
- takeover transition rules in the phase state machine
- telemetry spans for takeover and degraded mode
- LiveView display of coordinator identity and degraded-state banner

---

## Protocol Update 9 — Epistemically Grounded Closure Rules (Q20, 2026-04-28)

**Decision:** Four protocol changes derived from philosophy of mind literature
(predictive processing, social epistemology, BonJour's coherentism critique)
to improve reality-testing and reduce collective confabulation.

### Theoretical grounding

The Q19 failure was a coherentist closure: the IC selected the more
internally consistent position without verifying against external reality.
BonJour's Isolation Objection (*The Structure of Empirical Knowledge*, 1985)
provides the precise diagnosis: coherence alone cannot constitute empirical
knowledge. Longino's uptake conditions (1990) explain why the IC's authority
structure failed: valid criticism (Gemini's Elixir claim) did not produce
uptake. Corlett/Fletcher's predictive-processing account of delusion explains
the mechanism: priors (Codex's plausible citation) were weighted above
prediction error (Gemini's disconfirming claim).

### Change 1 — Typed claim provenance (effective immediately)

Every contested factual claim should carry a basis tag:

- `[observed]` — agent directly ran the command, read the file, or fetched and quoted from the URL
- `[testimony]` — agent reports what a source or another agent said
- `[inferred]` — derived from other claims

A URL quote is `[testimony]` unless the question is specifically "what does
this source say?" A quote is not an observation of reality; it is an
observation of a text.

### Change 2 — IC evidence precedence rule (effective immediately)

`[observed]` > `[quoted testimony]` > `[testimony]` > `[inferred]`

When two `[testimony]` claims conflict, the sub-question must remain
`[needs more evidence]` until an `[observed]` claim resolves it. The IC may
not close a contested factual sub-question on majority testimony, narrative
coherence, or citation count alone.

### Change 3 — Disconfirmation pass when fast consensus (effective immediately)

If all agents mark a factual sub-question `[satisfied]` within 2 turns, the
IC must assign one agent a **disconfirmation pass** before closing: find one
`[observed]` piece of evidence that could contradict the consensus, or
explicitly state what was looked for and not found. This guards against
Jump-to-Conclusions closure.

### Change 4 — Brief premise challenge before design closure (next round onwards)

Before closing any design question, at least one agent must answer: *"What
if a key premise in the BRIEF's framing of this question is false? What would
change?"* The IC includes this as a required prompt step when a question is
near closure. Guards against shared delusion from a false BRIEF premise.

### What was ruled out

- DTD (`Draws to Decision`) counter tag — the disconfirmation pass achieves
  the structural goal without requiring agents to self-report an
  unverifiable count
- Replacing the discussion format — all four changes are protocol changes,
  not architectural ones

---

## Q24 — Messaging Gateway (Round 15, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Telegram is the recommended first messaging gateway. Email (IMAP/SMTP) as a
secondary option. iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal ruled out for server-side receipt reasons or
approval complexity.

Telegram bot ingests prompts → roundtable service authenticates by Telegram user ID
bound to GitHub identity in Authentik custom attributes. The Telegram channel
complements the LiveView UI (it handles prompt injection and notifications); the
LiveView UI remains the right home for discussion repo management, round history
browsing, and satisfaction-state visualization.

**Brief premise challenge resolved:** Messaging gateway is in-scope once the core
orchestrator is functional. It is explicitly deferred until after items 1-22 ship.

---

## Q25 — Authentication Strategy (Round 15, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Authentik as OIDC proxy for GitHub OAuth (option c). The roundtable
Elixir app is an OIDC relying party to Authentik; Authentik federates GitHub as a
social provider. This gives:
- Centralized session management and SSO across homelab services
- MFA available via Authentik without custom code in the app
- GitHub identity available as a claim in the OIDC token

GitHub OAuth scopes required: `read:user`, `user:email`, and `repo` (for checking
collaborator access to private discussion repos). Permission checks against the GitHub
API; no local authorization table required.

**Collaborator flow:** GitHub OAuth → Authentik → OIDC token to app → app queries
`GET /repos/:owner/:repo/collaborators/:username` to gate access per discussion repo.

**Brief premise challenge resolved:** GitHub unavailability during homelab-only access
is acceptable for a personal tool. VPN (Tailscale) as a fallback for LAN-only access
mitigates the risk.

---

## Q26 — Service Hosting (Round 15, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Homelab first. Fly.io documented as fallback only if external collaborator
access is needed without VPN.

Gigalixir noted as technically viable (Elixir-native, no sleep on free tier) but not
the primary recommendation given homelab infrastructure already present.

Vercel ruled out: serverless/edge model is incompatible with long-running OTP processes
and LiveView WebSockets.

**Rationale:** See Q31 for updated analysis with full homelab context.

---

## Q27 — Discussion Repo Discovery (Round 15, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** `roundtable.toml` existence is the canonical identity signal. GitHub
topic `roundtable-discussion` is an optional convention for public-facing discoverability.
"Paste owner/repo slug" is the primary day-one UX for repo registration.

Auto-discovery (scanning user repos for `roundtable.toml`) deferred until a concrete
multi-user need exists. Rate limit concern: O(N) existence checks are acceptable for
a user with <100 repos; pagination + caching mitigates for larger accounts.

---

## Q28 — GitHub Alternatives (Round 15, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** SourceForge ruled out. GitHub remains the sole supported platform.
`DiscussionRepo.Backend` behaviour provides the abstraction point for future
Forgejo/Gitea support if needed.

SourceForge: declining platform, no modern OAuth API, reputation damage from 2015 adware
incident. Ruled out explicitly — will not resurface.

Forgejo: GitHub-compatible REST API surface; a `Roundtable.Adapters.Forgejo`
implementation would require minimal changes beyond `Roundtable.Adapters.GitHub`.
Not a current priority.

---

## Q29 — Discussion Repo Co-evolution (Round 16, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Standalone discussion repos are the default. Embedded (`docs/discussion/`)
is a valid opt-in for solo/public projects. Architecture supports both via the existing
`source` detection in `CLI.start_discussion/2`.

**Retrofit convention adopted:**
- Round 0 file: `round-00-retrofit-snapshot.md` with header
  `# Retrofit: Current State at <commit>`
- BRIEF.md opens with a retrofit notice block
- Service root: `DISCUSSION_REPO.md` (standalone only)

**`roundtable.toml` v1.1 additions:**
```toml
embedded = false
service_repo = ""
service_commit_at_start = ""
retrofit = false
```

---

## Q30 — Collaborator Permission Scoping (Round 16, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Service-mediated contributions (LiveView injection, Telegram bot) are
the primary model. The service acts as the GitHub write principal; discussion
contributors authenticate to the service, not directly to the repo. This makes
GitHub write access optional for discussion contributors.

For standalone public discussion repos: any GitHub user can read; the service gates
writes. For private standalone repos: `read` collaborator access is sufficient.

GitHub Discussions ruled out as round medium: content is not in git history and
cannot be forked (violates Q23 forkability requirement).

GitHub Organizations not required for solo+occasional-collaborator use case.

---

## Q31 — Homelab Infrastructure Revisit (Round 16, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Q26 recommendation confirmed and strengthened. Homelab is the correct
first-deploy target given:
- `deepwatercreature.com` publicly routable domain
- `router` machine running Caddy handles TLS automatically (Let's Encrypt) and
  WebSocket proxying for Phoenix LiveView without special config
- Unified `unified-nix-configuration` NixOS flake: adding the service is ~20 lines
  of NixOS module + one Caddy virtual host block
- NixOS `nixos-rebuild switch` is already the owner's deployment workflow; `fly deploy`
  adds a Docker build step with no net simplification for this user

**Caddy WebSocket note:** `reverse_proxy localhost:4000` forwards WebSocket upgrade
headers by default. Phoenix requires `PHX_HOST` set to the public hostname to prevent
CSRF errors — this is a one-line NixOS module config.

**Remaining open decisions (conditions for full Q31 closure):**
1. Public (`roundtable.deepwatercreature.com`) vs. VPN-only for external collaborator access
2. `PHX_HOST` value confirmed in NixOS module

**Fly.io:** Retained as documented fallback only if public access without VPN is required.

## Q32 — Protocol Self-Assessment (Round 17, 2026-04-29)

**Three structural flaws identified:**

1. **Anchoring** — agents speak sequentially and see prior responses; later agents
   anchor to earlier positions (Delphi literature)
2. **IC circular authority** — IC deliberates, triages, and closes unilaterally;
   no independent check on IC's framing or closure decision
3. **`[satisfied]` marker conflates genuine agreement with exhausted opposition**;
   creates misleading unanimity in the record

**What is preserved:** premise challenge requirement (Protocol 11); typed claim
provenance `[observed]`/`[testimony]`/`[inferred]` (Protocol 9).

### Protocol Update 13 — Structural Corrections

**Adopted immediately:**

**New marker: `[no objection]`**
Meaning: "No further evidence; not blocking closure; not asserting this is the
best answer." Distinguishes from `[satisfied]` (active agreement) and
`[needs more evidence]` (blocking). DECISION.md flags consensus formed primarily
from `[no objection]` as "convergent but not robust."

**Explicit warrant for contested `[inferred]` claims**
When agent A contests agent B's `[inferred]` claim: A must state the assumed
warrant and why it fails. IC must adjudicate the warrant dispute in the synthesis.

**Adopted in principle, deferred to first production run:**

**Challenger role at IC closure**
One agent (the first speaker that round, rotating) must articulate the strongest
alternative to the IC's proposed synthesis and rate it Low/Medium/High plausibility.
Medium or High triggers an additional round before closure.

**Deferred pending empirical evidence:**

**Blind first sub-turn** (Delphi-inspired): each agent writes initial position
without seeing others'; positions shared; second sub-turn follows. Adopted only
if anchoring is empirically present in first real agent run.

### Discourse Literature Incorporated

- Delphi method → blind first sub-turn proposal (deferred)
- Toulmin (1958) → explicit warrant for contested inferences (adopted)
- ODNI SAT/ACH → Challenger role at closure (deferred)
- Fishkin deliberative polling → "missing perspectives" IC prompt (future work item)
- Habermas ideal speech → typed provenance already addresses sincerity claim

### Q32 Addendum — Organizational Behaviour Literature (Round 17, 2026-04-29)

**Key finding:** LLMs inherit human group dynamics through training on group
outputs (committee reports, meeting summaries, consensus documents) — not just
individual writing. The sycophancy literature provides direct empirical support.
Structural corrections motivated on LLM-specific grounds.

**Adopted (Protocol Update 13 Addendum, all protocol-only):**

**IC mindguard check**
IC synthesis opens by quoting or closely paraphrasing the strongest dissenting
position. If no dissent: "No dissenting position recorded in this round."
Prevents silent absorption of minority views. *Source: Janis (1972) groupthink.*

**Double-loop framing check at question round 1**
IC prompt at first round of each question: *"What framings would lead to
different sub-questions than those in the BRIEF?"* Structural (not
agent-triggered) double-loop check against motivated BRIEF framing.
*Source: Argyris (1990) skilled incompetence + defensive routines.*

**Unique contribution prompt appendix**
Agent prompts end: *"Include at least one consideration not already raised
this round, or explicitly state you cannot identify one."*
Targets information sampling bias; "no unique contribution" is a useful
low-information-entropy signal. *Source: Stasser & Titus (1985).*

**Blind first sub-turn: re-prioritised**
Moved from "deferred" to "implement and evaluate at first real agent run."
Procedural context-conditioning (LLM-specific) is sufficient justification
independent of social anchoring. *Source: Delbecq & Van de Ven (1971) NGT.*

**Unchanged:** Challenger role at closure (Mason & Mitroff 1981 devil's advocacy
confirmed as correct scope — per-turn devil's advocacy would produce dialectical
inquiry, which is less effective for non-adversarial settings).

---

## Q33 — Adding DeepSeek as a Roundtable Agent (Round 18, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Add `:deepseek` (DeepSeek-V3) as a **fourth agent** via direct
Elixir HTTP (`Req`), not via `opencode` CLI. Default roster becomes
`[:codex, :gemini, :deepseek, :claude_ic]`.

### Model

- Regular agent turns: `deepseek-chat` (V3) — ~$0.0003/turn, fast, structured
- Challenger role at closure: `deepseek-reasoner` (R1) — activated at first
  production run; configurable via `:deepseek_model` option

### Invocation

Direct Elixir HTTP in `RunCliAgent`. `run/2` detects `:deepseek` and calls
`run_deepseek/2` via `Req`. Response text returned as `%{stdout: text}` —
no `extract_text/2` changes needed. This removes the CLI dependency for
DeepSeek; works in dev, CI, and production with only `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` set.

### Role in roster

Fourth agent, speaks before IC. `@agent_roles` description: *"You are DeepSeek,
an AI agent developed by DeepSeek AI. Bring independent analytical perspective
from a distinct training distribution. Focus on rigorous reasoning and
considerations potentially underweighted by agents trained on primarily
English-language corpora."*

**Noted alternative** (not adopted; revisit after first run): replace `:codex`
with `:deepseek` for cost efficiency if Codex/DeepSeek position diversity proves low.

### Key management

`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` env var. Homelab: agenix secret + NixOS module `EnvironmentFile`.
Dev: `.env` / shell export.

### Protocol Update 14

See ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md Round 18. Changes to implement (item 27):
1. `RunCliAgent`: add `:deepseek` to schema + `run_deepseek/2` HTTP handler
2. `Orchestrator`: add `:deepseek` to `@default_agents` + `@agent_roles`
3. NixOS module (item 26): add `deepseekApiKeyFile` option

---

## Q34 — AI Subscription Procurement (Round 19, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Sign up for DeepSeek API only. No additional subscriptions needed now.

### DeepSeek API

- **Platform:** `platform.deepseek.com`
- **Sign-up:** International email sufficient; no Chinese phone number required
- **Payment:** Visa/Mastercard accepted; pay-as-you-go; start with $5–10 credit
- **Estimated cost:** $0.50–$2.31/month (prompt caching reduces real cost significantly)
- **Rate limits:** Default new-account limits are sufficient for serial roundtable use
- **EU latency:** Acceptable; not a blocker

### Models not subscribed to

| Model | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Kimi (Moonshot AI)** | Skip | Long-context not needed; `platform.moonshot.cn` is Chinese-first; poor EU accessibility |
| **Xiaomi MiMo** | Skip (open weights) | 7B insufficient for roundtable prose quality; no subscription exists |
| **Qwen DashScope** | Defer | Registration friction; local open-weights route preferred if homelab VRAM allows |
| **Yi (01.AI)** | Skip | Not differentiated from DeepSeek for English technical analysis |
| **Doubao (ByteDance)** | Skip | Limited international API availability; Chinese enterprise focus |

### Homelab future paths (no subscription)

- **Ollama on inference VM:** `services.ollama.enable = true` in NixOS. Run MiMo-7B
  (~6GB 4-bit, or ~14GB FP16) for local reasoning experimentation.
- **Qwen2.5-Coder-32B via Ollama:** Worth evaluating as `:codex` replacement if
  inference VM has ≥24GB VRAM. Requires no subscription. Trigger: if Codex proves
  expensive or unavailable after first production run.

### Roster remains at four

`[:codex, :gemini, :deepseek, :claude_ic]` — fifth agent deferred indefinitely.
Diversity gain from a fifth agent with overlapping training distribution is
insufficient to justify added latency and cost. If `:codex` is replaced,
substitute rather than expand the roster.

---

## Q35 — Naming the Roundtable (Round 20, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Recommended name is **`millrace`**. Alternative: `dissensus`.

### `millrace`

Three layers of meaning:
1. **Mill** — John Stuart Mill, rational discourse, marketplace of ideas
2. **Race** — the engineered channel directing water's energy into productive work
3. **Structure** — the protocol channels multi-agent discourse through phases,
   markers, warrants, and satisfaction checks to produce reliable judgment

Properties:
- 8 characters, works as CLI command, Nix flake package, GitHub repo name
- Distinctive in the AI tooling space — no existing project conflicts found
- Evokes process and structure, not just conversation
- Pronounceable, memorable, suitable for conversation reference ("run it through millrace")

### Alternative: `dissensus`

More academically precise — names the protocol's distinctive contribution (structured
preservation of disagreement). 10 characters. Stronger intellectual signalling but
at the cost of approachability. Available if the owner prefers explicit over evocative.

### Naming exercise as protocol test

15 candidates were produced across 3 agents. The exercise demonstrated the protocol's
capacity for divergent thinking: candidates ranged from classical references (`lyceum`,
`agora`) to process metaphors (`crucible`, `assay`) to protocol-specific concepts
(`dissensus`, `legible`) to ironic/dark options (`panopticon`, `ordeal`). The protocol
produced genuine diversity, not just variations on a theme.

### Intellectual heritage encoded in the name

| Tradition | How `millrace` reflects it |
|---|---|
| Mill / rational discourse | Mill's name is in the word |
| High Modernism / legibility | A millrace is an engineered channel — structure imposed on nature |
| Anti-trap discourse | The channel prevents diffusion and waste — discourse without structure dissipates |

### Q35 Addendum — High Modernist Icons (Round 20, 2026-04-29)

The addendum drew on literary, architectural, and artistic High Modernism and
produced 10 additional candidates. The cultural vocabulary proved richer than
the abstract philosophical vocabulary from the main round.

**Revised recommendation: `parallax`**

Overtakes `millrace` after all three agents independently ranked it first or
second. The name works on three levels:
1. **Astronomical:** parallax is how you measure the distance to stars — you need
   multiple observation points to determine what is real
2. **Joycean:** the word recurs in *Ulysses* as Bloom's intellectual puzzle —
   literary Modernism at its most structured
3. **Protocol-specific:** the roundtable produces parallax — the same question
   viewed from multiple agent positions, with the IC triangulating truth from the
   displacement between them

Properties: 8 characters, unambiguous pronunciation, no dominant existing project
in AI tooling.

### Q35 Addendum 2 — Parallax Withdrawn, Musil Promoted (2026-04-30)

**Parallax withdrawn.** The Joycean reading — Bloom's parallax as skepticism
about convergence, not celebration of it — contradicts the tool's purpose at
the surface level. A name whose surface reading is the wrong reading is a
naming failure. All three agents agreed to withdraw.

**Musil promoted to #1.** The addendum deepened the case:
- Reading (iii) of the novel: structured deliberation is *both* valuable and
  limited — this is the roundtable protocol's actual philosophical position
- The Parallel Campaign demands *quality of attention* from participants;
  so does the protocol (provenance markers, warrants, satisfaction states)
- ACTIVE_DISCUSSION.md as primary artifact mirrors Musil's thesis that the
  process is the product
- 5 characters, distinctive, Kafka precedent for obscure literary names in tech

**"Unfinished" objection** (Gemini): the novel is incomplete, which may signal
the project will remain incomplete. Reframed: the novel is unfinished because
the question is unfinishable. The protocol's `[no objection]` marker exists
for exactly this — questions that cannot be closed with genuine `[satisfied]`.

**Revised ranking:**
1. `musil` — strongest intellectual case; Parallel Campaign as direct analogue
2. `millrace` — Mill + structural channel; self-explanatory without literary knowledge
3. `aktion` — from Parallelaktion; 6 chars; parseable without knowing Musil
4. `oulipo` — constraint as generative method; dark horse

`parallax` and `dissensus` dropped.

### Q35 Addendum 3 — Iterative Refinement Frame (2026-04-30)

**Reframing adopted.** The High Modernist novels (Joyce, Musil, Borges) are
critiques of rational convergence. The protocol is not claiming convergence —
it is doing iterative refinement: each round improves on the last, without
claiming to reach truth. This resolves the tension that plagued every literary
candidate.

**Revised recommendation: `anneal`**

From metallurgy and computer science: annealing subjects material to heat-cool
cycles that remove internal stresses and improve structural integrity. Simulated
annealing approaches an optimum through controlled randomness and iterative
cooling. The protocol anneals decisions: each round heats (agents challenge),
cools (IC synthesizes), and relieves internal stresses (disagreements, unexamined
assumptions). The result is structurally sound, not "true."

Properties: 6 characters, clear pronunciation, distinctive, no existing AI project
conflict. Both metallurgical and CS meanings are precisely right.

**Revised ranking:**
1. `anneal` — metallurgical + CS; heat-cool cycles removing stresses
2. `fugue` — contrapuntal voices; most beautiful name; 5 chars; psychiatric risk
3. `assay` — testing composition; most precise; 5 chars
4. `kiln` — controlled firing; shortest (4 chars); slightly craft-coded

Previous candidates (parallax, musil, millrace, oulipo, dissensus) superseded
by the iterative refinement reframing.

### Q35 Addendum 4 — Post-Ideological Pragmatism (2026-04-30)

**Further reframing adopted.** The materials science names (anneal, assay, kiln)
still carry a rationalist residue — an assumed telos. The owner's position:
structured discourse is *useful*, not *True*. No commitment to any ideology of
reason. Pragmatic, not programmatic.

**Revised recommendation: `hone`**

From craft: to hone is to refine a blade to working sharpness. Already idiomatic
for intellectual refinement ("hone an argument," "hone your thinking"). The name
explains itself without requiring knowledge of any intellectual tradition.

Properties: 4 characters, craft-rooted, post-ideological, no telos, no programme.
Zero existing AI project conflicts. Works as CLI (`hone run`), repo, flake
package, and conversation reference ("have you honed this?").

**Alternative: `crit`** — from art school critique culture. Work is presented,
discussed, revised. Determines whether the work *works*, not whether it is True.
4 characters. Same post-ideological quality, different register (art school vs
craft workshop).

**Revised ranking:**
1. `hone` — idiomatic, self-explanatory, craft
2. `crit` — art school critique, pragmatic
3. `sift` — separate fine from coarse; gentle, iterative
4. `whet` — sharpen enough for the work at hand

All previous candidates (anneal, fugue, musil, millrace, parallax, etc.)
superseded by the post-ideological reframing.

### Q35 Addendum 5 — Separation of Good from Flawed (2026-04-30)

Owner direction: the protocol's identity is *discernment* — removing flawed ideas,
preserving good ones. `thresh` is the right metaphor but needs more character.

**Unanimous recommendation: `winnow`**

First unanimous agent agreement in the entire Q35 discussion (5 addenda, 40+
candidates). Winnowing is the agricultural step after threshing: grain tossed into
the air, wind carries away the chaff, valuable grain falls back.

The protocol winnows: ideas are exposed to the wind of structured critique.
Insubstantial ideas blow away. Robust ideas survive not because of a theory but
because they are heavier — they withstand exposure.

Properties:
- 6 characters, poetic heritage (KJV, Milton, Keats), sounds like wind
- "Winnow the truth" is a recognisable English phrase
- Post-ideological, pre-industrial, no rationalist baggage
- No existing AI/tech project namespace conflict
- CLI: `winnow run` / Repo: `winnow` / Conversation: "winnow it"

Alternatives with more edge:
- `flail` (5 chars) — the threshing tool; controlled violence
- `crucible` (8 chars) — testing vessel; maximum drama

### Q35 Addendum 6 — Foreign Languages (2026-04-30)

Owner accepts winnowing metaphor but finds the English word uncatchy. Foreign
language search across Italian, Portuguese, French, Spanish, Greek, Swedish.

**Recommendation: `vaglio`** (Italian)

The winnowing sieve. In Italian, *passare al vaglio* means "to subject to
scrutiny" — the word already bridges the agricultural metaphor and intellectual
practice in its own language. 6 characters, musical ('gl' → 'ly' sound),
distinctive, namespace-clean. `vaglio run`.

**Alternative: `crivo`** (Portuguese)

The sieve/screen. 5 characters. Sharp 'cr-' opening, energetic sound. CREE-voh.
More punch, less music. `crivo run`.

Other candidates evaluated: `vanner` (French/English mining, 6 chars),
`krino` (Greek root of "criterion," 5 chars), `zaranda` (Spanish, 7 chars),
`vanna` (Swedish, 5 chars — Vanna White risk).

### Decision

**`vaglio` adopted** by the owner (2026-04-30). Internal name change effective
immediately. GitHub repo rename and code-level rename pending as work items.

---

## Q37 — Vaglio Evaluation Framework (Round 22, 2026-04-30)

**Decision:** Build a minimal eval framework comparing vaglio (multi-agent
protocol) to single-model baselines.

### Metrics (6)

1. **Consideration coverage** — unique substantive points (LLM judge)
2. **Self-consistency** — internal contradictions (LLM judge)
3. **Blind preference** — "which is more useful?" (human judge)
4. **Cost ratio** — token/dollar multiplier (computed)
5. **Dissent surfacing** — explicit counter-considerations (LLM judge)
6. **Training diversity** — proportion unique to one agent (computed)

### Task set

12 tasks: 5 replayed from Q1–Q36, 5 synthetic design questions, 2 code review.

### Three baselines

1. **Naive single:** Minimal prompt, one model
2. **Protocol-structured single:** Same vaglio prompt structure, one model
3. **Self-debate single:** One model generates 3 perspectives, then synthesizes

### Phased approach

Start with 6 tasks × vaglio vs. protocol-structured single. If vaglio wins
clearly (5/6+), expand. Budget: $7–20.

### Pre-registered hypotheses

- H1: Coverage 1.5–3x → if not, revise roster
- H2: ≥40% considerations unique to one agent → if not, agents redundant
- H3: Owner prefers vaglio ≥7/12 → if not, overhead not justified
- H-null: Structured single matches vaglio → protocol prompt is the product
- H-null-2: Self-debate matches vaglio → multi-agent architecture unnecessary

### Infrastructure

`Vaglio.Eval` module with `Run` struct, `Judge` (LLM-as-judge), `Metrics`
extraction. All intermediate state recorded. Results in `state/eval/` as JSON.

## Q36 — DeepSeek V4 Pro via Ollama Cloud (Round 21, 2026-04-29)

**Decision:** Upgrade to V4 Pro on direct API; do not switch to Ollama Cloud.

### Model upgrade

Upgrade `deepseek-chat` (V3) → V4 Pro when the model ID is confirmed on
`api.deepseek.com`. Key improvements relevant to roundtable:
- Better structured output adherence (satisfaction markers, provenance tags)
- Improved epistemic calibration (`[no objection]` vs `[satisfied]` distinction)
- Reduced sycophancy under protocol pressure (aligned with Protocol Update 13)

### Access path

Stay on direct `api.deepseek.com` HTTP via `Req`. Do not switch to Ollama Cloud.
- Direct HTTP is architecturally better than CLI subprocess dispatch
- Ollama Cloud adds intermediary for no current benefit
- Local fallback via Ollama is premature before first production run

### Implementation

1. Make model ID configurable via application config (replaces module attribute):
   ```elixir
   model = params[:deepseek_model] ||
           Application.get_env(:roundtable, :deepseek_model, "deepseek-chat")
   ```
2. Update config to V4 Pro model ID when confirmed on platform
3. No changes to API URL, auth, or dispatch pattern

### Deferred

- Ollama Cloud as fallback provider — revisit if direct API has reliability issues
- Local Ollama fallback — revisit when inference VM VRAM is confirmed
- Provider abstraction — not warranted with single provider

---

## Q38 Decision: Eval Landscape and Competitive Analysis (Round 23, 2026-04-30)

**Consensus:** All 3 agents satisfied.

### Key findings

1. Comparing vaglio to SWE-bench coding agents is substantially a category error
2. No public benchmark exists for multi-agent deliberation quality
3. Vaglio has no direct commercial competitors; AutoGen is closest framework
4. Custom evals (items 28-32) should be primary focus

### Eval strategy

- Complete items 28-32 as priority
- If H1/H2 confirm, run MT-Bench as credibility data point (80 questions, open-ended quality)
- Optionally run TruthfulQA subset for hallucination resistance (~$10-15)
- Do NOT run SWE-bench, HumanEval, MATH, or ARC-AGI
- Report cost-per-quality-unit and confidence intervals in all results

### Competitive positioning

- Vaglio's edge: open-ended design questions, premise challenge, calibrated
  confidence via disagreement, provenance transparency
- Not competitive on: single-answer tasks, code generation, latency-sensitive tasks
- Genuine competitors: AutoGen (framework), MoA (research), MAD (academic precedent)
- Not competitors: Bito, Cursor, Devin, SWE-Agent (coding agents, different problem)

---

## Q39 Decision: Karpathy's LLM Council and Market Position (Round 24, 2026-04-30)

**Consensus:** All 3 agents satisfied-conditional (all conditions: run comparative
evals within 60 days).

### Core finding

The "ask N models, combine" pattern has been commoditized by Karpathy's LLM Council.
Vaglio's defensible differentiation is the protocol layer: multi-round convergence,
satisfaction markers, typed provenance, premise challenges, coordinator failover,
anti-groupthink mechanisms. This has not been externally validated.

### Architectural comparison

| Feature | Karpathy Council | Vaglio |
|---|---|---|
| Dispatch | Single-pass via OpenRouter | Multi-round via CLI agents |
| Peer review | Anonymous (anti-bias) | Signed (provenance, but bias risk) |
| Convergence | Chairman picks best | Satisfaction protocol with FSM |
| Fault tolerance | None (stateless) | Coordinator failover, crash recovery |
| Provenance | None | Typed: observed/inferred/testimony |
| Anti-groupthink | 1 mechanism (anonymity) | 6 mechanisms |
| Complexity | Weekend project | 14+ work items, full orchestrator |

### Strategic imperatives

1. **Stop treating multi-model dispatch as the product** — that is commoditized
2. **Run evals comparing vaglio multi-round vs. Council single-pass** — add
   Council-style single-pass as a new baseline in items 28-32
3. **Adopt anonymous peer review** from the Council pattern
4. **Publish protocol as standalone specification** — become the standard, not
   just an implementation
5. **Position as "auditable AI deliberation protocol"** for regulated industries
6. **Do not chase the developer tooling market** — Cursor/Claude Code will own it
7. **Viable business model:** bootstrapped open-source with consulting, not
   VC-backed SaaS

### 60-day clock

Window between "validated pattern" and "commoditized feature" is closing. Empirical
evidence that multi-round deliberation outperforms single-pass Council synthesis
must be published before the market decides the simple version is "good enough."

---

## Q40 Decision: Publishing the Protocol as an Open Standard (Round 25, 2026-04-30)

**Consensus:** All 3 agents satisfied-conditional (all: evals must run first).

### Publication strategy

- **Primary artifact:** arXiv paper (8-12 pages, cs.AI) with eval results
- **Companion artifact:** GitHub spec repo (`v0.1.0`) with JSON schemas
- **IETF/W3C:** rejected unanimously as premature
- **Elixir codebase:** "original implementation" (not "reference implementation")

### Minimum viable spec (v0.1.0)

Normative layers:
1. Agent turn structure (message envelope, round numbering, coordinator role)
2. Satisfaction protocol (4 terminal markers, convergence rules)
3. Multi-round convergence (phase state machine, max rounds, escalation)

Recommended extension: epistemic provenance typing ([observed]/[inferred]/[testimony])

Deferred: anti-groupthink mechanisms (layers 5), coordinator resilience (layer 6)

### 60-day plan

- Weeks 1-4: Run evals (items 28-32) + draft paper
- Weeks 4-6: Finalize paper + extract spec into GitHub repo
- Weeks 6-8: Minimal Python example (~200 lines) + simultaneous release
- Outreach: COMMA/ArgMining for academics, HN/r/LocalLLaMA for practitioners

### Gate condition

If H-null confirms (structured single matches vaglio), the paper becomes a negative
result and the spec publication loses its justification. Evals are the existential
prerequisite.
